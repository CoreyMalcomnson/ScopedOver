Hi there!

Thank you for buying our Stylized Adventure Environment Pack. If you have any questions or want to contact us you can find us at www.hia3d.com

Here's some usefull information about the pack:

- Search for "Combined" assets, these are optimized so your scene doesnt have alot of drawcalls. 
These are merged to one object, although this pack is made so you can create your own assets with al the separate components. 
Keep in mind that your object count will go up rather fast when doing this, so this does require some optimization afterwards.

- The project is made in Linear color space wich can be found under Edit > Project Settings > Color Space > Set to Linear to get the same results as the pictures/videos.

- If you want the grass the despawn later or sooner, wichever quality you are going for, you can controll this by using the LOD bias found at Edit > Porject Settings > Quality > LOD Bias.
A higher LOD Bias means all LOD models will spawn further away, keep in mind this does decrease FPS because you are drawing more objects. So its a good balance finding the right settings, we found a bias of 2 is ideal.


Again thank you for buying our pack, do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.

Kind regards,
